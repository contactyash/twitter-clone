# Twitter-Clone
A fullstack twitter clone using react,apollo,graphql and prisma
a live demo available at https://twitter-clone-frontend.herokuapp.com/
## Tech Stack
I took Wes Bos's Advance React course and learned these stacks but instead of copying exact app , I built more advance and complex app
with following stacks
 ### React
 ### Apollo,Graphql
 ### Prisma
 ### Styled-components
## Features
 #### sign up, sign in are working but email verification is not working,thats for password reset also not workin
 #### tweet ,reply tweet working but media upload and poll in tweets are not working
 #### like tweet is just client side,clicking like button show increment and decrement on client but actually just increments on database
